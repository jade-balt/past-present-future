<p> I was born March 23rd, 2001 in Elkton Maryland! At the time, I was the youngest in my family, after my three older sisters and one older brother. But two years ago, my baby brothert Rory was born. Even though I lived in Maryland, I went to school in Delaware for my first year of high school, until  I moved to South Carolina in August. For elementary and middle school, I went to Mount Aviat Academy, and for my freshman year of high school, I went to St Mark's High School. At St Marks, I was on student council and played field hockey, lacrosse, and swimming.

I have also made new friends, but I am still close with my friends back in Delaware. My brother is a junior at JL Mann and all three of my sisters are in college, or have graduated. Also, I live with my mom, dad, older brother (Blayne), my younger brother (Rory), my grandmother and my dog Suade.</p>

<h2> My future! </h2>
<p> For my future, I want to either go to Duke or Berkely for college. After college, I want to go to medical school so I can become a plastic surgeon. Afer I finish my residency, I want to live somewhere in California, or move back up North. However, I do not want to live that far away from the rest of my family. I also want to have kids but not until I am older and already have established a career and have, hopefully, started my own medical practice.</p>
